                    <strong>On the occasion of Diwali, IRFT has organized Parivartan Craft Mela on 30th October, 2013 at Blue Sea, Worli.</strong>
                    <p>Parivartan Craft Mela, a first time effort on organizing a producer consumer meet by IRFT and Tata Capital Financial Services Limited. 24 organisations from various parts of India had represented their art work. The products ranged from rock dogra art from chatissgarh, warli art from Jawhar, bamboo work from Jharkhand, hand embroidery from Rajasthan and Gujarat name a few. Each product showcased an artisan's hardwork and passion as they were made by different sections of the society. We are grateful to Tata Capital for their confidence in IRFT and their commitment to the larger cause of sustainable livelihood through empowering entrepreneurship.</p>

                 <h4>IMPACT - DW Workshop Mumbai 2010</h4>
                 <p>IRFT conducted a training programme on Decent Work in Agriculture for the Implementing Partners of Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) on behalf of the Fair Labor Association (FLA). Better Cotton Initiative aims to improve the environmental and social impacts of cotton cultivation worldwide and make it more economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable. Decent Work forms an important component of this and in turn is a concept framed by the ILO and aims to offer women and men the opportunity to work with 'freedom, equity, security and human dignity'. IRFT being the local partners of FLA imparted a four day training programme in Mumbai between the 13th– 16th of July, 2010 on Training of Trainers who are engaged in implementing BCI’s projects in India. The training was interactive and stressed on the concept of ‘learning by doing’. Thus the training was significant in its delivery of creative communication tools, role plays and other PRA tools and techniques to ensure whole hearted learning and dissemination. Case studies and short films were also used for better and simpler understanding of issues on a macro and micro level to understand the impact of Decent Work.</p>

                 <h4>IRFT at Kala Ghoda</h4>   
                 <p>IRFT has been successfully participating in concern ongoing mela for the last five years. Every year IRFT provides a platform to a grass-root producer / artisan groups who are associated with us, from different parts of India, to showcase their products in the direct market in the exhibition/mela. This year IRFT had given the same platform to a producer group, from Latur, Maharashtra.<br>
The organization has got first hand experience on urban market. They sold their products worth Rs. 66,000.00 in five days. They have received many contacts of interested people who would like to buy directly from the organization.</p>    
                   
                  <p>This year we aimed to establish the " = " (equal to) sign as a symbol, 'Fairness in Trade', the right to a fair chance. The vehicle to promote this messaging was a "Dice" with six dots, on every side, unlike the regular dice. The messaging was “When we play a game called Ludo, we all aspire for six, because six gives us a chance to start the game, move forward and a chance to grow. Similarly, business is also a game. A dice with six dots in each side, will get six only whoever play the game in the supply chain, right from the farmer/ producer, the middle man, the brand owner as well as the consumer. IRFT choose 6 dots as it represents the highest number, thus progression to the next level and a Fair chance to grow.”</p>
