		            <h4>Ethical Training Workshop – Ethical Trading Initiative for Grape Growers.</h4>
		            
			        <p>IRFT conducted a training workshop in Nashik for the Growers of Grapes Direct, one of the UK’s Leading Grape supplier that falls under the supply chain of Sainsbury. The Grapes Direct was very keen to incorporate Ethical Trading Initiative(ETI) Base Code within their supply chain up to growers level and approached IRFT for the same.</p>
				    
				   <p>The training requirement was for Grape Exporters, Suppliers, Packhouse Workers and Grape Growers. As ‘Phase I’, a training was schudeled from 2nd December to 5th December’14 for the grape Growers supplying to the four Exporters i.e. DPS, Kalya, Seven Star and Pancea. As per the Needs Assessment done by IRFT prior to the training, a customised training module was created on the ETI Base Code looking at the practical ground realities and possibilities for the growers to make it feasible and practical. The module and learning tools were simplified and customized in local language (Marathi) to match up with the learning requirements and acceptance level of Grape Growers. The training was successfully delivered for more than 200 Growers over a period of three days. All the nine principles of ETI Base Code were discussed in detail. The workshops ended with a pledge taken by all the Growers in which they committed to follow and practice the prioritized key elements of Ethical Trade Base Codes in their day to day work life. A personal priority Plan Of Action was hence made by each growers in order to create a sense of urgency and importance of the same.</p>

			   	    <h4>Decent Work Training Program for Ambuja Cement Foundation.</h4>
				    <p>A 3 days capacity building training program on Decent work was delivered by IRFT for Ambuja Cement Foundation(ACF) at their Kodinar Unit, Gujarat, India in which the senior stafw of different projects from 5 locations had participated. The training focused on imparting the key indicators of the 8 major Decent Work principles ie; Child Labour, Discrimination, Freedom of Association, Health, Safety and Environment, Wages and Benefits, Hours of work, Harassment and Abuse, Forced Labour. The principles were based on the ILO standards and participants were guided with the purpose and practical implications of ‘Decent work’ in their existing community and infrastructure development projects. In order to adopt, incorporate and implement the Decent Work principles within their projects, cross learning sessions on an interactive basis were conducted to identify the possibilities of integration of different projects using the same resources and targeting the same beneficiary groups, within the umbrella of ACF. The entire training was designed keeping in mind the IRFT’s approach of ‘Learning by Doing’ and ‘Fun Learning’ which was enjoyed and well assimilated by most of the participants and some of the valuable quotes from them are as follows:</p> 
			   		<p><strong>Vikram Singh Dahima from Kodinar said</strong> “The training helped us to realize the very existence of Decent Work principles in our work areas and the importance of working on it’.</p>
			   		<p><strong>Jitendra Bais from Chandrapur said,</strong> “Though I have heard the word integration many a times, it is through this training that I understood the integration in its real sense and the possible practical interpretations of it in the project areas of ACF.’</p>	
			   		<p><strong>Sudhakar Pinumalla from Nadikudi said,</strong> “The interactive of Offer and Receive using the woollen balls as training tool helped us better understand the integration opportunities within the existing project areas of ACF”.</p>

			   		   <h4>IRFT – Master Trainer for the FLA Fire Safety initiative</h4>	
			   		   <p><strong>October 2013 – IRFT selected as the Master Trainer candidate from India.</strong></p>		
			   		   
			   		   	<p>The regional <strong>Workplace Fire Safety Facilitator Train the Trainer course</strong> was held in Sri Lanka during October and November 2013. The course is approved and validated by <strong>Institution for Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH)</strong> in association with the <strong>Fair Labor Association (FLA)</strong>.</p>
			   		   	
			   		   <p><strong>Training Goal:</strong> To enable individuals in factories to advocate a strong awareness of fire prevention and fire protection leading to shared attitudes, knowledge, perceptions and beliefs (= fire safety culture) by building national and corporate capacity, using accredited courses and certification.</p>		
			   		   
			   		   <p><strong>February &amp; March 2014</strong> – IRFT Master Trainer along with the Bangladesh Master Trainer delivered the first observation course of the Workplace Fire Safety Facilitator Course in Savar, Greater Dhaka.</p>  
			   		   
					<p>The key feature of the course is the Gap Assignment which the participants have to deliver during the gap period of 28 days between the two phases of the training. It was observed that the worker trainings i.e. 15 minutes teaching assignments were delivered in 7 different languages and to approx.300 workers in 20 workplaces collectively during the Sri Lanka and Dhaka course. Hence, as a group participants were able to touch 300 individuals with atleast one issue about fire prevention or fire protection which will lead to a change in their behavior with regards to fire safety.</p> 	
			   					
			   	   <p>IRFT is now a representative of the only internationally accredited fire safety training course for factories.</p>

			   	<h4>Training on Decent Work and Decent Living</h4>			
			   	<p><strong>IRFT delivered a three phase training project for Agrocel at the Cotton Gin in Dhrangadhra, Gujarat.</strong></p>	
			   	<strong>The three phases of the training focused on:</strong><br>
		   		<ul class="bullet-list">
					<li> Decent living conditions of the workers in the on-site labour quarters,</li>
					<li> Capacity building of the supervisors towards understanding and implementing the new HR system and</li>
					<li> Basic awareness of Health and Safety at the workplace for all the employees.</li>
                </ul>									
			   					
			   	<p>The three phases were designed based upon a detailed needs assessment involving the senior management, middle management and the workers and hence were inter-linked. Customized training modules were developed based upon the assessment of the facility and the labour quarters. The intervention was geared towards employee engagement hence regular in-training and outside training discussions were encouraged with all the employees. The training sessions were all interactive with the IRFT’s approach of‘fun-learning’ and learning-by-doing’ leading to maximum participation throughout the sessions.</p>

			      <h4>Partnership with Impactt Limited</h4> 							
			   	  <p>IRFT was chosen as a strategic partner by Impactt India Limited for capacity building on HR management systems. Impactt was a member of the Responsible and Accountable Garment Sector (RAGS)Benefit to Business and Workers (BBW) project funded by DFID during 2012-13. The aim of RAGS is to make responsible and ethical production the norm in the garment manufacturing sector supplying the UK. IRFT was chosen to impart training for ‘building skills in garment production management’ for the participating factories. The management was trained in a variety of areas, including production planning, quality management, and the organisation of production lines. </p>	
					
			   	 <p>IRFT has conducted HR management system capacity assessments for factories associated with Impactt Limited. The team assessed the current HR practices in the factories through system review, management and worker discussions. The findings were utilized to identify opportunities to improve HR practices and work with management to agree towards a practical solution-based approach.</p>
		   					
		   		<br>	
	          				
		          <h4>Syngenta Seeds Ltd.</h4> 							
			   	  <p>The Fair Labor Association (FLA) engaged IRFT in developing monitoring instruments and pilot field audits for two years for Syngenta Seeds Inc. for the okra crop in Gujarat. Post audit, various remedial strategies on Labour Monitoring of the agricultural sector were discussed in a consultation workshop in Hyderabad in December 2008. Syngenta then approached IRFT to help build capacity of their staff and farmers/ growers in social compliance (FLA- COC) in the three states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. IRFT developed creative communications tools to motivate staff, farmers, and organizers of the Syngenta seed production business.</p>	
				 
				 <br>	
				 
				 <h4>Project on Social Responsibility in Leather and Textile/Garment sector in India</h4>														
			   	 <p>Working conditions in textile, clothing, and leather industries are all too famous for often running under conditions breaching minimum social standards as a whole. In many garment and sport-shoes producing countries, the organized Civil Society generally supports initiatives from Northern Countries organisations aiming to back local undertakings with a view to make social conditions improve. However, the Southern organisations quite rightly consider that initiatives emanating from foreign countries are not to be used as an alternative to substitute for their legitimate role.</p>
		   		<p>That’s why the Collective De l’ethique sur l’etiquette is in the process of in-depth dialogue with such organizations to make expertise sharing fulfill expectations. As part of this work the collective engaged IRFT to carry out a survey in India. This survey was aimed at collecting analysis and recommendations from various Indian partners.</p>
		   			
		   		<br>	
	   	    
	   	    								
		   	    <h4>Safe Food India</h4>		
		   		<p>International trade in high-value food products such as fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, fish, meat, nuts and spices has expanded enormously in the last twenty-five years. However, there is also an increase in the consumer concern about food safety due to the recent food scares regarding contamination of food with banned dyes, chemicals, pesticides and the links between animal and human disease. This has led to stringent product regulations and additional quality requirements, which are not necessarily required under the law but are being imposed by the buyers.</p>
		   		<p>FAKT Germany, with its experience in the field of designing and conducting food quality management coursers in collaboration with IRFT India, Traidcraft Exchange UK, envisaged a project to build capacities in the food industry to establish suitable food safety and quality management systems that strengthen the export capacities of the Indian SMEs.</p>
