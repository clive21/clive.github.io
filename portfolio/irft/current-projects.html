	  				<h4>IRFT successfully conducted the 3rd Full Circle Learning (FCL) Workshop on ‘Strategic Project Proposal’</h4>							<p>After the successful completion of the second workshop on Strategic Fund Raising, IRFT with the support of Transpek Industries Limited, have taken the training to the next level. On 30th July and 5th August, 2014, IRFT successfully conducted the Third Workshop on ‘Strategic Project Proposal’ for seven participants from the five social enterprises with whom IRFT works closely with. For this session IRFT has adopted an innovative approach of customized, one on one session with each organisation to initiate a closed view of the serious need based attempt to represent an organisation for funder proposals.</p>																											
		  			<strong>The steps:</strong><br>																						
			  		<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>Personalized assessment of each participant and organisation</li>
						<li>Developing the customized project proposal plan during the session.</li>
						<li>First drafts to emerge at the end of the session.</li>
						<li>Second  and third draft to be detailed by a dated date</li>
						<li>Final project proposal submission to funder by dated deadline.</li>
                    </ul>																								
                   	<strong>Each organisation’ customized proposal plan is supplemented by the following learning strategies:</strong><br>
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
						<li><strong>Group learning -</strong> As a group, participants shares their experiences and motivates each other’s learning in the process.</li>
						<li><strong>Coaching and feedback -</strong> Trainer provided the direction and helps to prepare each proposal. Participants are allowed to give feedback on other organisations project proposal, and help to assess their goal and objectives.</li>
						<li><strong>Self-directed learning -</strong> In addition to the group learning and feedback sessions, which all participants complete together, each organisation develops a project proposal plan that outlines the learning’s of the day. </li>
                    </ul>	
                    
                    																							
                    <p>IRFT reiterated that funding is not money, it’s about Causes; therefore Trainees need to understand that the cause supersedes the organisation needs and growth. The beneficiary growth and efforts to sustain themselves is the priority for funding and funds at large.</p><p>At the end of the sessions, participants realized that funder is interested in the social cause, own interest and the need to introspect about how relevant is the organisation growth vs. the beneficiary gain. The Project Proposal took on a different representation with a new outlook towards funding.</p>	
                    <p>Ms. Kiran Badhe from Samruddhi Mahila Seva Sanstha says “I was ignorant about how to write a proposal, but now, I know the steps and IRFT has given us a reference document to follow. I will give my regular drafts to IRFT team to review.”</p>

These paintings were given as momento to the guests on the grand occasion of the anniversary celebration and were highly appreciated by all.</p>
                    <p>27 women undertrials have been registered for vocational trainings provided under the Jail intervention project. Courses on Stitching and Bead work were organized in collaboration with Self Help Centre (not-for-profit).

By doing these activities, the prisoners not only develop the self confidence and self esteem out of the valuable labour put in by them but these activities also lead them towards earning a honourable livelihood after their release from the prison.</p>
