		        <p>On the occasion of the 150 years of celebration, IRFT is privileged to honour St. Stanislaus High School, as The First Fair Trade School-India, having met the criteria to hold this title and adopt the concept. St. Stanislaus has not only promoted the cause of Fair Trade to their students from Std V to X but also to the family members and the community in and around the school. In appreciation of the unstinted support of the principle Rev Fr. Jude Fernandez and his team, IRFT is honoured by the continuous engagement with the school, moreso by including Fair Trade Principles in the Curriculum of the Std VII and VIII in Environmental Studies. The school has been awarded with a trophy and a School Fair Trade Policy.</p>

		        	<p>To ensure IRFT’s mission of livelihood enhancement of the small and marginal sections of the society by supporting and promoting fairness in trade”, IRFT has introduced ‘Fair Trade Certified Raisins’, produced by a farmer organization called Agrocel. The raisins have come from Indian state of Maharashtra. This certification ensures that the farmers have been given a fair price and that a fair trade premium goes towards the development of the farming community towards ensuring the long-term sustainable development.</p>								<strong>IRFT has created a special gift pack of raisins that we visualize as a perfect gift for you :</strong><br>

                    <h4>IRFT conducts workshops on ‘Fair Trade’ at St. Stanislaus High School, Bandra…</h4>
                    <p>IRFT conducted workshops on “Fairness in Trade” with 200 students studying in Grade VII of St. Stanislaus High School, Bandra, Mumbai in March, 2012. To make the young minds understand the concept of Fairness along the supply chain, the contents were simplified and the sessions were made interactive. Students were curious to know the concept of Fair Trade and were able to relate it to benefits of Fairness along the supply chain. They pledged to educate their friends and family members to consciously buy products especially those with the label of ‘Shop For Change’. The session ended with an overwhelming response to a quiz competition. This is the beginning of including Fair Trade awareness in the curriculum of St. Stanislaus High School, a very enlightened school to embrace the concept of Fair Trade.</p>

                    <h4>‘St. Stanislaus High School and IRFT promotes No Plastics’</h4>
                    <p>St. Stanislaus High School and IRFT have been closely associated for the promotion and awareness building on Fair Trade and fairness along the supply chain, addressed to each and every student of St. Stanislaus.</p>
					<p>The intervention began with the launch of a mascot named E(FT)Y who appeared for the first time on a book mark meant for every children followed closely by a newsletter called ‘EFTY Express’. Through the engagement with EFTY every child is meant to take home the message of Fair Trade and fairness to small producers to his home of at least five adults who would also get an understanding of why they should support Fair Trade.</p>		
				    <p>On the occasion of Children’s Day, St. Stanislaus celebrated Fair Trade with a Family Poster compition that engaged children and their families to surf internet and discover the world of fair trade. A reference book, simplifying the concept for children was also distributed to help, understand and emulate the need to be fair and choose a fair trade product.</p>	
					<p>In continuous engagement with the very proactive school and principle Fr. Jude Fernandes, IRFT and St. Stanislaus participate together to promote ‘No Plastics’ on the streets of the busy bazar road in Bandra. 225 students of St. Stanislaus, 8th std, division A, B, C & D trooped into the busy lane led by the school band in the morning at 10 am on Saturday, 25th Feb 2012. Each child had to convince 4 shoppers and hand over a free cloth shopping bag each. A small effort by young adults who are tomorrow’s sensible social leaders.</p>

					<h4>IRFT conducts a workshop on “Fair Trade” at HIM Academy, Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh!</h4>  		 										<p>IRFT’s zeal to promote Fair Trade, made it expand its reach miles away up to the North of India. The audiences were the young enthusiasts of the HIM Academy Public School in Hamirpur. On October 13, 2011 the workshop was organized to introduce the students and the teachers alike on the concept of ‘Fairness in Trade’. The workshop was attended by more than 80 students and teaching staff from the 10th Grade. Students were enthusiastic to know the concept and the ways by which they can contribute in promoting Fair Trade. The trainers from IRFT adopted a fun filled way of putting across the message using games and involved students through role plays. By the end of the workshop students were able to understand the difference between a conventional supply chain and a Fair Trade supply chain. It was illustrated when the kids started relating this to their family business and volunteered to give examples. The workshop ended with a pledge to spread the message of Fair Trade amongst friends, family and society.</p>

                       <p>Fair Trade actively encourages the better environmental practices and the application of responsible methods of production. Considering this we envisaged the relevance of participation in Bhavan’s college Nature festival – Prakruti, from January 21st to 23rd, 2011. It was a golden opportunity to capture the nature lover audience visiting the fest and educate them on Fairness in Trade.</p>
                       <p>Around 4000 to 5000 nature adoring college students from the well known colleges like Bhavan’s college, S.P. Jain Management institute got exposed to the fair trade and they expressed full support to the Fair trade products. A Mumbai based fair trade organization Women’s India Trust was invited to exhibit and sell their products.</p>
